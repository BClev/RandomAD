# Useful Modules

I mentioned the fantastic NTFSSecurity module today. You can get it in a few ways

1. `Install-Module NTFSSecurity` if running Powershell v5 or higher
2. [Download](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NTFSSecurity/4.2.3) the repository from the Gallery, and save it in $PSModulePath after unzipping.
